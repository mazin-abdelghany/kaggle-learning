# Maching Learning with Python using Kaggle
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I am creating to practice machine learning skills with Python.  Each project is contained within its own folder and each folder contains the Jupyter notebook, the data used&mdash;if public&mdash;and any other files used during the project. If the data are private, data sources are indicated in each Jupyter notebook's Markdown cells.
