# Maching Learning with Python using Kaggle
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I am creating to practice machine learning skills with Python.  Each project is contained within its own folder and each folder contains: (1) the Jupyter notebook, (2) the data used&mdash;if public&mdash;and (3) any other files used during the project. If the data are private, data sources are indicated in each Jupyter notebook's Markdown cells.

The below table of contents will be modified as new analyses are added.

### Titanic Dataset
This is an exploration of the well-known Titanic dataset and my first implementations of machine learning models while learning Python. The Jupyter Notebook contains:
1. some short exploratory data analysis, 
2. an assessment of missingness within the dataset, 
3. imputation of these missing data using multiple methods,
4. an assessment of how model performance of a logistic regression model varies based on the method of imputation
5. an exploration of the learning curves for a logistic regression model
6. an exploration of the learning curves for a random forest model
7. an attempt at feature engineering to improve model performace.
