# Maching Learning with Python using Kaggle
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks that I have used to practice basic machine learning skills with Python.  Each project is contained within its own folder, which contains the Jupyter notebook and the data used, if public. If the data are private, data sources are indicated in each Jupyter notebook's Markdown cells.
